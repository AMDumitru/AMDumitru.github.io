<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p1>During high school, I kept a small journal for a while in which I would occasioanlly write about some Physics problems I came up with. I decided to archive them here for posterity's sake.  </p1>
<h3>P1. Beer Pong</h3>
<p2>A Ping-Pong ball of mass \(m=2.7 g\) is thrown horizontally with velocity \(\langle v_0, 0\rangle\) from the height \(y_1=0.4 m\) measured with respect to a \(l=2 m\) long table, at the end of which there lies a cup with height \(y_2=7.5 cm\), in which it enters (that is to say, the ball passes through \(\langle 2,0.075\rangle\)). Knowing that the air resitance encountered by the ball is proportional to the speed by a factor of \(k=1.1225\pi*10^{-4}\), what is the original velocity of the ball?</p2>

<p3>Furthermore, if the ball had to hit the table at least once, assuming a perfectly elastic collision, what would be the minimum velocity for which it would enter the cup?</p3>
